**代码：**
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minBuildTime(self, blocks: List[int], split: int) -> int:
        n = len(blocks)
        if n == 1: return blocks[0]
        heapq.heapify(blocks)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a = heapq.heappop(blocks)
            b = heapq.heappop(blocks)
            c = b + split
            heapq.heappush(blocks, c)
        return blocks[0]
```
